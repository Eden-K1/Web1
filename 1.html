<h2>Little Women 작은아씨들</h2>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>I <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/" target="_blank" title='html5 specification'>remember myself</a> enjoying reading the Little women book with illustrations.
  Despite the enjoyment I had from reading it over quite a number of times, I wasn't really exicted when the movie came out.
  By then I had forgotten many details of the story and only a weak impression was left with me.</p>
<img src="desertnsky.jpg" width="100%">
  <p>"I've been angry every day of my life," Mrs. March says matter-of-factly, and while "Little Women" is full of silliness and sorrow, sweetness and warmth, it doesn't minimize or apologize for that anger.
Nor does it mock or marginalize the March family's commitment to social justice, civic responsibility and artistic excellences. All of those were, for Alcott, part of the mainstream of American culture.</p>
